# Morning Game Plan — Tuesday 25 Feb 2026

> **Account:** $150k TakeProfit Trader | **Risk/trade:** $1,500 | **Contract mode:** MICRO
> **Session window:** 3:00 AM – 12:00 PM EST | **Flatten all by noon**

## 1. Overall Market Bias

**Mildly bullish.** Equities (S&P, Nasdaq) leading with positive overnight flow and highest
VWAP premium. Metals mixed — negative overnight prints but holding above VWAP with tight
ranges, positioned for a catch-up move via Gold-Silver correlation (0.75) and the
metals-equities bridge (0.30–0.40). Crude Oil stable positive.

**Playbook:** Continuation longs above VWAP in the first 2 hours. Look for pullbacks to
entry zones rather than chasing. Do NOT fade equities today.

### Asset Rankings

| Rank | Asset     | Contract | $/pt   | Why                                                                 |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | S&P       | MES      | $5     | Highest volume, 0.38% above VWAP, Nasdaq corr 0.96, clean trend    |
| 2    | Silver    | SIL      | $1,000 | Best backtest stats, overnight dip exhausted, leads Gold via corr   |
| 3    | Gold      | MGC      | $10    | Above VWAP, pivot bounce setup, Silver confirmation available       |
| 4    | Crude Oil | CL*      | $1,000 | Positive overnight, low ATR for tight risk, stable macro backdrop   |
| 5    | Copper    | MHG      | $2,500 | At pivot, highest VWAP premium (0.56%), metals cluster confirmation |

> *\*Crude Oil uses full CL — see Section 2 note.*

**Ranking rationale change vs. Grok draft:** S&P promoted to #1 based on *current session*
strength (highest volume, strongest VWAP position, positive overnight). Backtest stats
inform edge but today's conditions should drive rank. A 100% recent win rate on a small
sample is noise, not a signal — but the volume and trend confirmation are real.

## 2. Trade Plans — Micro Contracts (except Crude Oil)

All position sizes are calculated from the **worst-case entry** (top of the zone for longs)
to guarantee risk never exceeds $1,500. RR is shown as a range from best-case entry to
worst-case entry.

### Trade 1 — S&P 500 (Rank 1)

| Field           | Value                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contract**    | MES (Micro E-mini S&P 500) — $5/point                     |
| **Direction**   | LONG                                                       |
| **Entry zone**  | 6890.00 – 6900.00                                          |
| **Stop loss**   | 6870.00                                                    |
| **Take profit** | 6935.00                                                    |
| **ATR**         | ~18 pts                                                    |
| **Stop width**  | 20–30 pts (1.1–1.7 ATR ✓)                                 |
| **Risk/ct**     | 30 × $5 = **$150** (worst) · 20 × $5 = $100 (best)       |
| **Contracts**   | **10** (sized from worst case: $1,500 / $150)              |
| **Total risk**  | $1,500 (worst) · $1,000 (best)                             |
| **Total reward**| 10 × (35 to 45) × $5 = **$1,750 – $2,250**               |
| **RR**          | **1.17:1 – 2.25:1** (midpoint ~1.60:1)                    |
| **Rationale**   | Strongest current setup. 0.38% above VWAP with top volume confirms buyers in control. Nasdaq corr (0.96) provides real-time confirmation. SL widened from Grok's 6875 to 6870 to clear 1 ATR from worst entry. |

> **Scaling plan:** Enter 5 MES at 6890–6895 (lower half). Add 5 more only if price holds
> above 6895 for 10+ minutes with Nasdaq confirming above its VWAP.

### Trade 2 — Silver (Rank 2)

| Field           | Value                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contract**    | SIL (Micro Silver) — $1,000/point                          |
| **Direction**   | LONG                                                       |
| **Entry zone**  | 87.20 – 87.28                                              |
| **Stop loss**   | 86.95                                                      |
| **Take profit** | 87.65                                                      |
| **ATR**         | ~0.25                                                      |
| **Stop width**  | 0.25–0.33 pts (1.0–1.3 ATR ✓)                             |
| **Risk/ct**     | 0.33 × $1,000 = **$330** (worst) · 0.25 × $1,000 = $250 (best) |
| **Contracts**   | **4** (sized from worst case: $1,500 / $330 = 4.5 → 4)    |
| **Total risk**  | $1,320 (worst) · $1,000 (best)                             |
| **Total reward**| 4 × (0.37 to 0.45) × $1,000 = **$1,480 – $1,800**        |
| **RR**          | **1.12:1 – 1.80:1** (midpoint ~1.40:1)                    |
| **Rationale**   | Best backtest sharpe. Overnight dip exhausted with price stabilizing at VWAP. Silver leads Gold in this correlation regime (0.75). SL widened from 87.00 to 86.95 to clear 1 ATR from worst entry and avoid the round-number cluster. |

> **Scaling plan:** Enter 2 SIL at 87.20–87.22. Add 2 more on confirmation that Gold
> holds above its own VWAP. Do NOT add if Gold is breaking down.

### Trade 3 — Gold (Rank 3)

| Field           | Value                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contract**    | MGC (Micro Gold) — $10/point                               |
| **Direction**   | LONG                                                       |
| **Entry zone**  | 5178.00 – 5182.00                                          |
| **Stop loss**   | 5168.00                                                    |
| **Take profit** | 5198.00                                                    |
| **ATR**         | ~8 pts                                                     |
| **Stop width**  | 10–14 pts (1.25–1.75 ATR ✓)                               |
| **Risk/ct**     | 14 × $10 = **$140** (worst) · 10 × $10 = $100 (best)     |
| **Contracts**   | **10** (sized from worst case: $1,500 / $140 = 10.7 → 10) |
| **Total risk**  | $1,400 (worst) · $1,000 (best)                             |
| **Total reward**| 10 × (16 to 20) × $10 = **$1,600 – $2,000**              |
| **RR**          | **1.14:1 – 2.00:1** (midpoint ~1.50:1)                    |
| **Rationale**   | Above VWAP (0.09%), pivot bounce setup. SL widened from 5172 to 5168 to get 1.25 ATR clearance from worst entry. TP extended from 5192 to 5198 to compensate, targeting the next pivot resistance. Requires Silver confirmation. |

> **Scaling plan:** Enter 5 MGC at 5178–5179 only. Add 5 more if Silver is already
> printing above 87.25. If Silver is below 87.15, skip this trade entirely.

### Trade 4 — Crude Oil (Rank 4)

| Field           | Value                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contract**    | **CL (Full-size Crude Oil)** — $1,000/point                |
| **Direction**   | LONG                                                       |
| **Entry zone**  | 66.25 – 66.35                                              |
| **Stop loss**   | 66.05                                                      |
| **Take profit** | 66.70                                                      |
| **ATR**         | ~0.12                                                      |
| **Stop width**  | 0.20–0.30 pts (1.7–2.5 ATR ✓)                             |
| **Risk/ct**     | 0.30 × $1,000 = **$300** (worst) · 0.20 × $1,000 = $200 (best) |
| **Contracts**   | **5** (sized from worst case: $1,500 / $300)               |
| **Total risk**  | $1,500 (worst) · $1,000 (best)                             |
| **Total reward**| 5 × (0.35 to 0.45) × $1,000 = **$1,750 – $2,250**        |
| **RR**          | **1.17:1 – 2.25:1** (midpoint ~1.60:1)                    |
| **Rationale**   | Positive overnight (0.03%), stable above VWAP. SL widened from 66.10 to 66.05 to get 1.7 ATR clearance minimum. |

> ⚠️ **Why full CL instead of MCL?** Micro crude (MCL, $100/pt) with a 0.30 stop = $30
> risk per contract. To reach $1,500 risk you'd need 50 contracts — impractical for
> execution and slippage. Full CL at 5 contracts is clean and manageable.
>
> **Alternative if you want micros:** Use 10 MCL contracts, accept $300 total risk (reduced
> sizing), and treat this as a "pilot" position you can add to on confirmation.

### Trade 5 — Copper (Rank 5)

| Field           | Value                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contract**    | MHG (Micro Copper) — $2,500/point                          |
| **Direction**   | LONG                                                       |
| **Entry zone**  | 5.955 – 5.975                                              |
| **Stop loss**   | 5.935                                                      |
| **Take profit** | 6.020                                                      |
| **ATR**         | ~0.025                                                     |
| **Stop width**  | 0.020–0.040 pts (0.8–1.6 ATR)                             |
| **Risk/ct**     | 0.040 × $2,500 = **$100** (worst) · 0.020 × $2,500 = $50 (best) |
| **Contracts**   | **15** (sized from worst case: $1,500 / $100)              |
| **Total risk**  | $1,500 (worst) · $750 (best)                               |
| **Total reward**| 15 × (0.045 to 0.065) × $2,500 = **$1,688 – $2,438**     |
| **RR**          | **1.13:1 – 3.25:1** (midpoint ~1.70:1)                    |
| **Rationale**   | Highest VWAP premium (0.56%) signals momentum. At pivot level for bounce. Metals cluster correlation (Silver 0.56, Gold implied) for confirmation. SL widened from 5.940 to 5.935 to clear round number. |

> ⚠️ **Copper micro liquidity note:** MHG is less liquid than the other micros. Check
> bid-ask spread before entry. If spread > 2 ticks, reduce to 8–10 contracts or skip.

> **Scaling plan:** Enter 8 MHG at 5.955–5.960. Add 7 more if Silver is confirming
> above 87.20 and S&P is holding above 6890.

## 3. Position Sizing Cheat Sheet

| Asset     | Contract | $/pt   | SL Dist (worst) | Risk/ct | Contracts | Total Risk |
|-----------|----------|--------|------------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| S&P       | MES      | $5     | 30 pts           | $150    | 10        | $1,500     |

## 4. Correlation Rules — Entry & Exit Gates

### Primary Pairs

| Pair              | Corr  | Entry Gate                                            | Exit Gate                                         |
|-------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Gold ↔ Silver     | 0.75  | Only enter Gold if Silver holds > 87.15. Only enter Silver if Gold holds above its VWAP. | Exit Silver if Gold breaks below VWAP. Exit Gold if Silver breaks 86.95. |
| S&P ↔ Nasdaq      | 0.96  | Only enter S&P if Nasdaq > its VWAP and trending up. | Scale out S&P if Nasdaq diverges (drops while S&P holds). |
| Copper ↔ Silver   | 0.56  | Copper entry requires Silver above 87.15 as metals confirmation. | Fade Copper if it lags equities by > 0.5% from VWAP. |
| Copper ↔ S&P      | 0.43  | Secondary. Copper strength supports broad bullish bias. | If both Copper AND Silver break below VWAP, cancel all metals longs. |

### Hard Rule

> **No trade if 2 or more correlated assets are below VWAP.** If S&P is below VWAP
> and Nasdaq is below VWAP → no equity entries. If Gold AND Silver are below VWAP →
> no metals entries. Period.

### Correlation Caveats

- A 0.75 correlation still leaves ~44% of variance unexplained — it's a filter, not a guarantee.
- Correlations shift intraday. If Gold-Silver diverge by > 1 ATR in opposite directions, pause and reassess — the regime may be breaking.

## 5. News & Events Checklist

> ⚠️ **This section must be completed BEFORE the session opens. Check all items.**

### Pre-Session Calendar Review (do this NOW)

- [ ] **Check CME FedWatch** for any overnight shift in rate expectations
- [ ] **Check economic calendar** (ForexFactory / Investing.com) for:
  - Fed speakers (exact times)
  - US consumer confidence or housing data
  - Weekly crude oil inventories (API Tues night / EIA Wed morning)
  - Any China PMI or trade data (metals/copper catalyst)
- [ ] **Check overnight price action** for gaps > 1 ATR against bias (skip rule applies)
- [ ] **Scan headlines** for geopolitical risk, tariff announcements, or surprise data

### Known Standing Risks

- **Fed speakers:** Any hawkish surprise can spike VIX and reverse equity longs instantly. If a Fed speaker is scheduled during the session, reduce position size by 50% or stand aside for that window.
- **Crude inventories:** API report typically drops Tuesday ~4:30 PM EST (after session). No impact on today's AM session, but Wednesday morning CL could gap.
- **China data:** Any surprise PMI print can move Copper ± 1–2 ATR. If China data drops during session, close Copper immediately and reassess.

### Time-Based Rules

| Time (EST)        | Action                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-3:00 AM       | NO entries. Prep and review only.                         |
| 3:00 – 3:30 AM   | Observe opening range. Place limit orders if levels hit.  |
| 3:30 – 10:00 AM   | Primary entry window.                                     |
| 10:00 – 11:30 AM  | No new entries. Manage open positions only.                |
| 11:30 AM          | Begin closing all positions.                              |
| 12:00 PM          | **HARD CLOSE. Flatten everything. No exceptions.**        |

---

## 6. Risk Management Rules

### Per-Trade Risk

| Rule                    | Value                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Max risk per trade      | **$1,500** (calculated from SL × point value × contracts)  |
| Max contracts per trade | Sized to risk — see cheat sheet above (micro allows more)  |
| Max simultaneous risk   | **$4,500** across all open positions                       |
| Pyramiding              | **None.** Scale in within the entry zone only, not above.  |
| Gap rule                | If market gaps > 1 ATR against your bias at open, **skip that asset** |

### Daily P&L Controls

| Threshold               | Action                                                    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **-$1,500** (soft stop)  | Flatten all positions. Take a 30-minute break. May re-enter ONE trade if setup is A+. |
| **-$2,250** (hard stop)  | Flatten all. **Done for the day. No re-entry.**           |
| **+$3,000** (profit cap) | Consider stopping. If you continue, tighten all stops to breakeven. |

### Position Management

- **Move stop to breakeven** once price reaches 1:1 RR (halfway to TP).
- **Partial exit** (50% of contracts) at 1:1 RR, let the rest run to TP.
- **Trail stop** on remaining contracts: move SL up in 0.5 ATR increments as price advances.
- **Time stop:** If a trade hasn't moved 0.5 ATR in your favor within 45 minutes of entry, close at market. Dead trades tie up capital and attention.

### Account Context

| Field                  | Value          |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Starting balance       | $150,000       |
| Daily loss removed     | $4,500         |
| 1% risk               | $1,500         |
| Contract mode          | **MICRO** (MES, MGC, SIL, MHG) + **FULL** (CL only) |

## 8. Changes from Grok Draft

| Issue | Grok Original | Corrected |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Contract type** | Unspecified (math didn't match any standard contract) | Explicit micro contracts + CL for crude |
| **Position sizing** | Claimed $1,500 risk but math didn't reconcile | Every trade verified: contracts = floor($1,500 ÷ (worst_stop × $/pt)) |
| **Stop widths** | Sub-ATR on Silver (0.20) and Crude (0.15) | All stops ≥ 1.0 ATR from worst-case entry |
| **RR claims** | Quoted best-case only (bottom of entry zone) | RR shown as range (best → worst), midpoint highlighted |
| **Asset ranking** | Driven by backtest stats (Sharpe 16, 86% WR on small N) | Re-ranked by current session strength; backtest stats inform, don't drive |
| **News/events** | "Check at open" | Structured checklist to complete BEFORE session |
| **Crude Oil sizing** | MCL would need 50+ contracts for $1,500 risk | Switched to full CL (5 contracts) with MCL alternative noted |
| **Copper spec** | point=250 (doesn't match CME HG or MHG) | MHG micro copper at $2,500/pt |
| **Scaling** | "4 contracts" flat, no plan | Entry in 2 tranches with correlation confirmation for second tranche |
| **S&P stop** | 6875 (would exceed $1,500 on ES at 3 contracts) | MES at 10 contracts with 6870 SL = $1,500 clean |
